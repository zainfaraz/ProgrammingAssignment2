## Below are the pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix which reduces the computational cost.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that sets the value of a matrix, gets the value of a matrix, sets the inverse of a matrix and 
## gets the inverse of a matrix and  can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m <- NULL
set <- function(y){
x <<- y
m <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x 
setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve 
getsolve <- function() m
list(set = set, get = get, setsolve = setsolve, getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
m <- x$getsolve()
if(!is.null(m)){
message("getting cached inverse of a matrix")
return(m)
}
data <- x$get()
m <- solve(data, ...)
x$setsolve(m)
m
}
